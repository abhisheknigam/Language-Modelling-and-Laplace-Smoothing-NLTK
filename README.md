# Language-Modelling-and-Laplace-Smoothing-NLTK
Language Modelling of "Moby Dick" Corpus using NLTK Library

## Calculated a bigram language model with smoothing of that corpus using python’s NLTK package (http://www.nltk.org/).

1. Readable Code and granular results can be found in PDF File.

2. .ipynb file contains the runnable code. Simply open the file in Anaconda and run the entire file.
  a. To Download Ananconda follow the link  
     ### https://www.anaconda.com/download/?lang=en
  b. To install NLTK simply run in your .ipynb notebook   
     ### ! pip install NLTK 

3. Results.csv contains the language model probabilities achieved through Laplace smoothing for top 25 unigrams of the corpus.

4. .html file is provided for any referncing if you want to open directly in a browser.
